# British Airways Booking Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project is part of the Forage virtual internship program, focusing on the analysis of the British Airways booking dataset. Our goal is to extract meaningful insights and predict booking completions with high accuracy, precision, and recall. We employ a variety of machine learning models and rigorously evaluate their performance to ensure efficacy in our predictive tasks.

## Feature Selection
We have implemented feature selection techniques to identify the most influential factors contributing to booking completions. This allows us to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of our models, providing British Airways with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The Python snippets included in this repository encapsulate our approach to model training, evaluation, and feature selection. These data-driven solutions demonstrate the potential of machine learning in the aviation industry.

## Results
After applying various machine learning models, we have narrowed down to two that show superior performance:
- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy of 72.5%, Precision of 71.6%, Recall of 74.5%
- **XGBoost**: Accuracy of 72%, Precision of 71%, Recall of 74.6%

The Logistic Regression model is preferred for its slightly higher accuracy and precision, which are vital for the reliability of the predictions.

## Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model's robust performance makes it the optimal choice for forecasting booking completions, potentially assisting British Airways in enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Submission
This project is submitted by Viraj Panchal as part of the completion of the Forage virtual internship program.
